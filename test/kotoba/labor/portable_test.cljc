(ns kotoba.labor.portable-test
  "What this library promises on every host, checked on every host.

  `kotoba.labor` says it is portable `.cljc` across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI /
  GraalVM, and until now that sentence was the only place the claim existed:
  `deps.edn` had one runner and it was the JVM one, so ClojureScript never ran
  a single assertion. The claim was not failing -- it was unmeasured, which
  reads exactly like measured-and-fine.

  Running the existing suite on a second host immediately separated the two.
  `(+ 8 nil)` throws NullPointerException on the JVM and evaluates to `8` on
  ClojureScript, so a timesheet with one entry missing its hours crashed one
  host and quietly under-reported the other. The under-reported number is not
  an error value; it flows through `wages-for` into a payroll `gross` and gets
  paid. Nothing downstream can tell it from a shorter shift.

  These tests run under both `clojure -M:test` and `nbb test/run_portable.cljs`.
  A test that only ever runs on one host cannot see a divergence between two."
